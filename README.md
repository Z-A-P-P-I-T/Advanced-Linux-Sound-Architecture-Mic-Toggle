# Advanced-Linux-Sound-Architecture-Mic-Toggle
Here is a very short script that might come in handy if you wan't to quickly be able to disable/enable your microphone.

Since Alsa subsides under Pulse there is no way to add a On/Off functionality without using the Alsa toggle.

Usage:
chmod +x endimic.sh
sudo ./endimic.sh
