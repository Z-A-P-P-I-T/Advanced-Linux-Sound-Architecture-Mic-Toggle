# Advanced-Linux-Sound-Architecture-Mic-Toggle
Here is a very short script that might come in handy if you wan't to quickly be able to disable/enable your microphone.

Since ALSA subsides under Pulse there is no way to add 'On/Off' functionality without using the Alsa toggle.

Usage:

chmod +x endimic.sh

sudo ./endimic.sh
